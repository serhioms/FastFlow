# Fast Flow
Simple, light and very fast workflow engine which perform sequential, parallel and asynchronous tasks in thread pool executor. Where workflow is bunch of tasks and transitions.

This is a regular Maven project.

# What is not implemented?
There is no joins in fast flow but forks only. There is no conditional transitions but unconditional only. 

# What is special?
It is multithreaded and very fast! Almost same fast as [LMax Disruptor](https://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html) because of non blocking thread synchronization. It makes it twice faster then original blocking algorithm demonstrated by [Federico Peralta high-order runnables](https://github.com/boundsofjava/boj-newsletter-001/blob/master/src/main/java/com/boundsofjava/newsletter/higherorderrunnable/HigherOrderRunnable.java) in his great article ["The bounds of java"](http://boundsofjava.com/newsletter/001-higher-order-runnables). 

Since [LMax Disruptor](https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor) get announced by [LMax](https://www.lmax.com/) multi-threaded programming become a downtrend way of doing high performance programming in java. Lets get it back! We are leaving in the world of multi-core CPU! By the way nothing can stop you from using thread pool executor with one thread only...

Another feature is generic workflow context which represents task data.

# Big idea
The Big Idea is switching from MVC toward MVW where classic controller done vie workflow! There are lots of advantages from this approach like easy parallel programming (as simple as sequential), controller logic visualization (like any workflow does), task unification. Lets get out of hard-coded controller in your application. 

## Sequential execution
Sequential execution start by executing the first task and continue by executing next task in sequence. Usually it requires one thread only. But fast flow executes them most likely in separate threads with non-blocking synchronization in between. Start given task, after end of task pickup next one from the sequence and queued it up into executor's queue.

## Parallel execution
For given number of parallel tasks we need same amount of threads to run them all in parallel aka simultaneously or concurrently. Depends mostly on how many CPU cores are in place. Summarize all that pros and cons fast flow set size of thread pool executor exactly same as number of CPU cores. Then queues all parallel tasks into executor's queue. As soon as last one ends pick up next task from parent flow without blocking parent thread but just calculating number of performed parallel children instead!

If you are single thread adherent or LMax Disruptor follower just set up thread pool having one thread only. Fast flow engine guarantee all work be done regardless any complexity of sequential-parallel-asynchronous tasks composition in your workflow.

## Asynchronous execution
From [XPDL](http://www.xpdl.org/standards/xpdl-2.2/XPDL%202.2%20(2012-02-24).pdf) prospective asynchronous tasks equivalent to NON-BLOCKED AND-FORKED transitions to number of asynchronous tasks. Looks exactly same as parallel execution but without any thread synchronization between parent and children - parent queued them all in executor queue and forget. Then fast flow engine pick up next task from parent flow and continue execution logic regardless of state of any asynchronous child.  

Actually combination of sequential tasks and asynchronous tasks in your workflow with thread pool size equals 2 equivalent to [Disruptor Flow project](https://github.com/serhioms/DisruptorFlow) presented in my github public page. Lets compare performance of same flow then:

## Exception handling

Exception Handler is generic class which flow disruptor call on any exception during task execution. There is a default handler implemented as simple as System.err messenger.

	    dflow.setExceptionHandler(new ExceptionHandler<TestContext>(){
	        @Override
	        public TaskTransition handleTaskException(TestContext context, Throwable ex) {
	            System.err.printf("Flow failed due to %s\n", ex.getMessage());
	            return TaskTransition.Fail;
	        }
	    });

## Workflow context

Flow context can be any java class object. Context object must be provided once per flow run. The context will be propagated among all executed tasks.

    public class TestContext {
    	***
    }
    
    flow.run(new TestContext());

## Usage
Since fast flow is not published at any maven repository you can [download latest jar](https://github.com/serhioms/DisruptorFlow/blob/master/distribution/fastflow-1.0.0.jar) and include it in your project. Otherwise try source code.
